## Hands on BALTRAD
The BALTRAD approach will be introduced by outlining the ways in which it is commonly deployed, and then the data representation model used by the software will be explained.

Following this introduction, course participants will get the chance to aquaint themselves with the look and feel of the BALTRAD Toolbox by running through a few notebooks that address data representation, quality control, compositing, and other features. Among the notebooks is one that demonstrates interoperability, how two software packages can pass data to each other, between BALTRAD and Py-ART.

This is the first time the BALTRAD content will be available in the cloud through the Pangeo deployment. Most, if not all, of the functionality should work as long as the Pangeo instance is available. The Open Radar Virtual Machine will serve as a back-up solution.
