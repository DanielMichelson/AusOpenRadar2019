A Binder/Pangeo executable repository for the one day Open Science workshop at the 2019 Australian Radar Workshop


The course will take place on November 12th 2019, right before the Australian radar workshop. We will introduce the participants to [community software packages](http://openradarscience.org) designed for radar data processing, including (but not limited to) [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/), [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/), and [wradlib](https://wradlib.org). Following a welcome, there will be an introduction to Open Science concepts and the Open Radar context.

The common ground for most of those tools is Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. The course will be deliverd using cloud based solutions like Binder and Pangeo. As a backup we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) that contains all the required software, data, and course materials. 


### List of tutors
