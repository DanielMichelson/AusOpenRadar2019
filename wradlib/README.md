## Hands on wradlib
In this session, we will get to know the wradlib package. The main entry point to wradlib is [https://wradlib.org](https://wradlib.org) which will link you to wradlib's documentation, user groups, GitHub repositories, and more.

The Jupyter notebooks will work as long as the Pangeo cloud instance is available. The Open Radar Virtual Machine will serve as a back-up solution.
